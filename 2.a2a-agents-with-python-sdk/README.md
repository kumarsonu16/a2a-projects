Starting the Client (in a new terminal):

# Open new terminal, navigate to project
cd samples/a2a-python-sdk

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

uv run python -m client.client --agent-url http://127.0.0.1:10003


# Example Weather Interactions

# Single-turn Weather Interaction:

Weather query: What's the weather in Tokyo?

# Expected response flow:

Processing: What's the weather in Tokyo?

The weather in Tokyo is partly cloudy with a temperature of 27.2¬∞C (81¬∞F). The humidity is quite high at 89%, and there's a gentle breeze blowing from the NNE 
at 6.1 km/h. It feels like 30.4¬∞C (86.7¬∞F). Consider wearing light, breathable clothing due to the humidity. A light jacket might be useful for the evening. 
Enjoy your time in Tokyo! üóº‚òÅÔ∏è


1. Task submitted
2. ‚ÄúSearching for current weather in Tokyo‚Ä¶‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúProcessing weather data and formatting response‚Ä¶‚Äù
4. Rich weather report with temperature, conditions, humidity, wind, and recommendations


# Multi-turn Weather Interaction:

Weather query: What's the weather like?

# Agent response:
Processing: What's the weather like?

To give you the most accurate weather update, I need to know where you are! üåç Please tell me the city and state/country (e.g., 
"New York, NY" or "London, UK"). üìç


As you can see, the user query is unclear about the weather, i.e., which location he wants the weather details for; hence, the agent asks him to specify the location properly so that he can provide the weather details.


# Your reply: Bangalore, India


# Final result: Detailed weather report for Tokyo with beautiful formatting and local recommendations.

`OK! Here's the weather for Bangalore, India:

üå°Ô∏è Temperature: It's currently 24.4¬∞C (75.9¬∞F). Expect a high of around 29¬∞C during the day and a low of 21¬∞C tonight.
‚òÅÔ∏è Conditions: Partly cloudy.
üí® Wind: From the Northwest at 18.4 kph.
üíß Humidity: 74%

It feels like 26¬∞C. Consider wearing light, breathable clothing. A light jacket might be useful for the evening. Enjoy your day in
Bangalore! üåÜ`

## üîÑ Complete Flow Description

### 1. **User Interaction**
- The user runs the client (`client.py`) and enters a weather query (e.g., "What's the weather in Tokyo?").

### 2. **Client Communication**
- The client discovers the agent‚Äôs capabilities via the A2A protocol.
- It sends the query to the agent server using HTTP (JSON-RPC).

### 3. **Server Request Handling**
- The server (`__main__.py`) receives the request and passes it to the `WeatherAgentExecutor`.
- The executor manages the task lifecycle and event queue (streaming updates, multi-turn).

### 4. **Agent Logic**
- The executor calls the `WeatherAgent` (LangChain + Gemini + Tavily).
- The agent processes the query:
	- If location is missing, asks for clarification.
	- Uses Tavily for real weather data (or mock if API key missing).
	- Formats the response with actionable advice and emojis.

### 5. **Streaming Updates**
- The executor streams progress events (searching, processing, completed) back to the client.
- The client displays updates in real time (using `rich` for formatting).

### 6. **Multi-turn Conversation**
- If more info is needed (e.g., location), the agent requests it.
- The client prompts the user and continues the conversation until completion.

### 7. **Task Completion**
- The agent sends a final weather report.
- The client displays the result to the user.

## üí° Key Concepts

- **A2A Protocol:** Event-driven, supports streaming and multi-turn conversations.
- **WeatherAgent:** Uses LangChain, Gemini, and Tavily for real-time weather info.
- **Executor:** Bridges agent logic to A2A protocol, manages events and tasks.
- **Client:** Discovers agent, sends queries, handles streaming updates, supports multi-turn.
